# Allocation Engine — Spec artifacts

Context for handoff (idea-writer, implementers). Everything we iterated on, condensed.

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **ALLOCATION.md** | How allocation works: segmentation, weighted greedy, priority score, fairness, optimization, Audit Trail step-through. |
| **DATA.md** | Reps + Accounts schema, validation, empty state, baseline for comparison, export. |
| **DESIGN-DECISIONS.md** | Why we chose threshold vs weights, 5-band scale, tooltips required, three pages, Streamlit, slider ranges. |
| **wireframes.md** | Full UI: Territory Slicer, Territory Comparison, Audit Trail. Component details, slider config, fairness color scale, implementation notes. **Includes V3 modern redesign.** |
| **UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md** | Complete UI design system: colors, typography, spacing, component patterns, Ramp/Notion aesthetic. **Required reading for all UI work.** |

**IDEA.md** (parent folder) — Problem, goal, and high-level task (dynamic threshold, equitable distribution, visual output).

**Handoff:** Point the idea-writer (or builder) at this folder + IDEA.md. No need to pass the full conversation; the artifacts are the source of truth.
