# Jam Bootstrap for Terr Slicer

Look for `.jam` file to confirm this is a jam-enabled project.

Load and follow the jam-master role from the shared jam installation.
The jam_path in .jam points to where jam packs are located.

# Artifact Access

When accessing jam artifacts (roles, skills, rules, patterns), use the jam CLI:

1. Start a session: `jam session start --context="..."`
2. List artifacts:  `jam list roles|skills|rules|patterns`
3. Get artifact:    `jam get --session=<id> @project:type/name`

Always use the full @project:type/name format (e.g., @jam:role/go-implementer).
